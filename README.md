# Tailwind CTA Component

A simple and responsive Call To Action (CTA) component built using **Tailwind CSS**.

Made while learning Tailwind by actually building something instead of just reading classes and forgetting them later 🙂

## Live Demo

## What I learned
- Using Tailwind utility classes for layout and spacing  
- Building responsive layouts with Flexbox  
- Switching layouts using breakpoints (`flex-col` to `flex-row`)  
- Styling buttons without writing custom CSS  

## Tech used
- HTML  
- Tailwind CSS (via CDN)

## Note
This is a small practice project created as part of my Tailwind CSS learning journey.
